# Devcontainers

This repo contains set of devcontainers with pre-installed software, creating various playground environments.

All images are based on ubuntu 20.04.

## How to use

Most of the images assume local docker and kubernetes installation to lower the image size.
The base images come with pre-installed and configured software for each playground which I typically use when creating blogs and other content.

Each base image comes with a devcontainer.json file which you can use together in VS Code or just use base image pulling from DockerHub.

Image Tag denotes a different base image.
